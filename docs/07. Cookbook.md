This section will help you to further understand how ZfcRbac works by providing more concrete examples. If you have
any other recipe you'd like to add, please open an issue!

## A Real World Application

In this example we are going to create a very little real world application. We will create a controller `PostController` that interacts with a service called 
`PostService`. For the sake of simplicity we will only cover the `delete`-methods of both parts. 

Let's start by creating a controller that has the `PostService` as dependency:

```php
class PostController
{
    protected $postService;
    
    public function __construct(PostService $postService)
    {
        $this->postService = $postService;
    }
    
    // addAction(), editAction(), etc... 
    
    public function deleteAction()
    {
        $id = $this->params()->fromQuery('id');
        
        $this->postService->deletePost($id);
        
        return $this->redirect()->toRoute('posts');
    }
}
```

Since we have a dependency, let's inject it using the `ControllerManager`, we will do this inside our `Module`-Class

```php
class Module 
{
    // getAutoloaderConfig(), getConfig(), etc...
    
    public function getControllerConfig()
    {
        return [
            'factories' => [
                 'PostController' => function($cpm) {
                     // We assume a Service key 'PostService' here that returns the PostService Class
                     return new PostController(
                         $cpm->getServiceLocator()->get('PostService')
                     );
                 }
            ]
        ];
    }
}
```

Now that we got this in place let us quickly define our `PostService`. We will be using a Service that makes use
of Doctrine, so we require a `Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager` as dependency.

```php
use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;

class PostService
{
    protected $objectManager;
    
    public function __construct(ObjectManager $objectManager)
    {
        $this->objectManager = $objectManager;
    }

    public function deletePost($id)
    {
        $post = $this->objectManager->find('Post', $id);
        $this->objectManager->remove($post);
        $this->objectManager->flush();
    }
}
```

And for this one, too, let's quickly create the factory, again within our `Module` class.

```php
class Module 
{
    // getAutoloaderConfig(), getConfig(), etc...
    
    public function getServiceConfig()
    {
        return [
            'factories' => [
                 'PostService' => function($sm) {
                     return new PostService(
                         $sm->get('doctrine.entitymanager.orm_default')
                     );
                 }
            ]
        ];
    }
}
```

With this set up we can now cover some best practices.

## Best practices

One mistake most beginners do is protecting their applications using guards only. This leaves your application open for
some undesired side-effects. As a best practice you should protect all your services by injecting the authorization 
service. But let's go step by step:

Assuming the application example above we can easily use ZfcRbac to protect our route using the following guard:

```php
return [
    'zfc_rbac' => [
        'guards' => [
            'ZfcRbac\Guard\RouteGuard' => [
                'post/delete' => ['admin']
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

Now, any users that do not have the "admin" role will receive a 403 error (unauthorized) when trying to access
the "post/delete" route. However, this does not prevent the service (which should contain the actual logic in a properly
design application) to be injected and used elsewhere in your code. For instance:

```php
class PostController
{
    protected $postService;

    public function createAction()
    {
        // MUHAHAHA DOING SOMETHING EVIL!!!
        $this->postService->deletePost('2');
    }
}
```

You see the issue! The solution is to inject the `AuthorizationService` into your services, and checking for the
permissions before doing anything wrong. So let's modify our previously created `PostService`-class

```php
use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;

class PostService
{
    protected $objectManager;
    
    protected $authorizationService;
    
    public function __construct(
        ObjectManager        $objectManager,
        AuthorizationService $autorizationService  
    ) {
        $this->objectManager        = $objectManager;
        $this->authorizationService = $autorizationService;
    }

    public function deletePost($id)
    {
        // First check permission
        if (!$this->authorizationService->isGranted('deletePost')) {
            throw UnauthorizedException('You are not allowed !');
        }
        
        $post = $this->objectManager->find('Post', $id);
        $this->objectManager->remove($post);
        $this->objectManager->flush();
    }
}
```

Since we now have an additional dependency we should inject it through our factory, again within our `Module` class.

```php
class Module 
{
    // getAutoloaderConfig(), getConfig(), etc...
    
    public function getServiceConfig()
    {
        return [
            'factories' => [
                 'PostService' => function($sm) {
                     return new PostService(
                         $sm->get('doctrine.entitymanager.orm_default'),
                         $sm->get('ZfcRbac\Service\AuthorizationService') // This is new!
                     );
                 }
            ]
        ];
    }
}
```

Of course, you have to configure a permission provider so that the Rbac container is aware of this permission. In
your config, add the following code:

```php
return [
    'zfc_rbac' => [
        'permission_providers' => [
            'ZfcRbac\Permission\InMemoryPermissionProvider' => [
                'deletePost'  => ['admin']
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

For more information about permission providers, please refer to [this page](/docs/05. Permission providers.md).

### When using guards then?

In fact, you should see guards as a very efficient way to quickly reject access to a hierarchy of routes or a
whole controller. For instance, assuming you have the following route config:

```php
return [
    'router' => [
        'routes' => [
            'admin' => [
                'type'    => 'Literal',
                'options' => [
                    'route' => '/admin'
                ],
                'may_terminate' => true,
                'child_routes' => [
                    'users' => [
                        'type' => 'Literal',
                        'options' => [
                            'route' => '/users'
                        ]
                    ],
                    'invoices' => [
                        'type' => 'Literal',
                        'options' => [
                            'route' => '/invoices'
                        ]
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
};
```

You can quickly unauthorized access to all admin routes using the following guard:

```php
return [
    'zfc_rbac' => [
        'guards' => [
            'ZfcRbac\Guard\RouteGuard' => [
                'admin*' => ['admin']
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

## Using dynamic assertions

Sometimes, using permissions alone is not enough. For instance, let's reuse the example for the previous part, more
specifically the `deletePost` method:

```php
public function deletePost($id)
{
    // First check permission
    if (!$this->authorizationService->isGranted('deletePost')) {
        throw UnauthorizedException('You are not allowed !');
    }

    $post = $this->objectManager->find('Post', $id);
    $this->objectManager->remove($post);
    $this->objectManager->flush();
}
```

This code protects your service so that only users that have the `admin` role can delete a post. However, this allows
*any* admin to delete *any* post. Instead, we want to make sure that only the admin author of a specific post can
delete its own post.

To handle this case, ZfcRbac allows you to specify assertions as the second argument of `isGranted` method. Assertions
can either be a callable (closure...) or any class that implements `ZfcRbac\Assertion\AssertionInterface`.

> The ZF2 RBAC component also comes with an interface for assertions (`Zend\Permissions\Rbac\AssertionInterface`). However,
you cannot not use it, as the signature is not the same (the ZF2 assertion interface does not give you access to the
`AuthorizationService`).

Each assertion gives you access to the current identity. Here is an example:

```php
public function deletePost($id)
{
    $post = $this->objectManager->find('Post', $id);

    $assertion = function(IdentityInterface $currentIdentity = null) {
        return $currentIdentity === $post->getAuthor();
    };

    // First check permission
    if (!$this->authorizationService->isGranted('deletePost', $assertion)) {
        throw UnauthorizedException('You are not allowed !');
    }

    $this->objectManager->remove($post);
    $this->objectManager->flush();
}
```

## Optimize for production

ZfcRbac is already quite efficient, but there are some ways to make it even faster.

### Use cache

ZfcRbac allows you to specify a cache for role and permission providers (especially useful for providers that load
data from database).

You can either specify a service key that is fetched from service manager (the returned cache must
implement `Zend\Cache\Storage\StorageInterface`):

```php
return [
    'zfc_rbac' => [
        'cache' => 'myCache'
    ]
];
```

Or using a `Zend\Cache\Storage\StorageFactory::factory` compliant config:

```php
return [
    'zfc_rbac' => [
        'cache' => [
            'adapter' => 'apc'
        ]
    ]
];
```

## Using ZfcRbac with Doctrine ORM

TBD

## How to lazy-load roles and permissions for very complex use cases?

In small to medium applications, you usually only have a few roles and permissions. To that extent, using the
built-in [role providers](/docs/04. Role Providers.md#built-in-role-providers)
and [permission providers](/docs/05. Permission Providers.md#built-in-permission-providers) is usually enough. For
instance, the `InMemoryRoleProvider` allows you to specify all your applications' roles into a PHP config array, while
the `ObjectManagerPermissionProvider` allows you to load all the permissions from a table.

However, this is not possible to store all roles/permissions in memory if you have thousands of them. In those cases,
you likely want to lazy-load only a subset of roles/permissions based on the matched roles and asked permission.

### Force the reload

By default, ZfcRbac only load roles and permissions one time to keep great performance. It happens the first time
`isGranted` method is called. However, if you have a lot of permissions, what you want is actually trigger a load
each time `isGranted` is called:

```php
$authorizationService->isGranted('editPost'); // Hit the database to load data
$authorizationService->isGranted('deleteAuthor'); // Hit again the database to load more data
```

To enable this behaviour, update your ZfcRbac config to enable force reload:

```php
return [
    'zfc_rbac' => [
        'force_reload' => true
    ]
]
```

### Creating custom role providers and permission providers

You now need to create custom role providers and permission providers.

To learn about how to create and register custom role providers, please [refer to this section](/docs/04. Role Providers.md#creating-custom-role-providers).
To learn about how to create and register custom permission providers, please [refer to this section](/docs/05. Permission Providers.md#creating-custom-permission-providers).

For instance, here is a permission provider that would load permissions from database only for the current user roles:

```php
use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectRepository;
use ZfcRbac\Permission\PermissionProviderInterface;
use ZfcRbac\Service\RbacEvent;

class FilterPermissionProvider implements PermissionProviderInterface
{
    protected $objectRepository;

    public function __construct(ObjectRepository $objectRepository)
    {
        $this->objectRepository = $objectRepository;
    }

    public function getPermissions(RbacEvent $event)
    {
        $roles = $event->getRoles();

        return $this->objectRepository->findBy(['roles' => $roles]);
    }
}
```

## Using ZfcRbac and ZF2 Assetic

ZfcRbac breaks [Assetic](https://github.com/widmogrod/zf2-assetic-module) when the `Guard` returns unauthorized. You can fix this by adding this to your `module.config.php`:

```php
    'assetic_configuration' => array(
        'acceptableErrors' => array(
            \ZfcRbac\Guard\GuardInterface::GUARD_UNAUTHORIZED
        )
    )
```
